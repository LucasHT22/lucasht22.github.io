## Cosmos


## Budget & Buying

I had not more than 40 USD to spend on this project, so I had to take extreme actions:

| Part | Price | Link | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Filament | N/A | N/A | I got some old yellow filament from a friend |
| Switches | $6 | | Outemu switches was definitely not the best option but was the only compatible with budget |

## Printing



## Welding
